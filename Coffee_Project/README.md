Conclutions and perspectives:

1) There is a lot of information that can be infer from these visualizations. One thing that is important to keep in mind is the fact that Global Coffee Trade (GCT) can be segmented by two periods, calendar year and the
   crop year. In last one, countries are divided in three groups: April, July and October groups. To understand the dynamics of GCT involves from which country are countries importing Coffee, on which month of the year
   according to this crop group could be related with the prices to retail and also the market price. Along with this, the climatological features of growing a specific type of coffee could affect this dynamic due to
   countries that are only intrested in importing Arabica or Robusta Coffee.

2) This datasets does not have the percentage or the relation between those countries that produces both types of coffee, from the visualizations it is possible to infer that Brazil is the biggest country producing coffee,
   and also produces both types of coffee. However, we do not know how much of this coffee is related to Arabica or Robusta, which does not allow us to compare with countries that only produces Arabica or Robusta. About the
   missing values, I aim for considering like 0 values instead of replace them for the mean or other statistics.

3) In cases like Colombia, where the exports are almost at the same level of the total production, it could be interesting to look more in details the reason of this behaviour, and try to look if there is a conection 
between this data. Is it possible that people in Colombia prefer to consume other kind of drinks instead of coffee? If Colombia is well-known as the "Country of coffee" why is not in the top 3, at least, in the domestic
consumption ranking? Considering the fact that Colombia produces only Arabica coffee, does Colombian people prefer Robusta coffee than Arabica coffee?

4) Having the price paid to growers (an average), it would be intersting to know what is the relation between this and the value of the coffee on the market and the retail prices. This, because in countries like Colombia,
   coffee growers argue that the prices at which they sell the Coffee are almost the same at people buy a cup of Coffee.
